# Filter List Component

This repository is a code example used to demonstrate testing of React components in the Pluralsight Course 'Testing in React 18'.

The `FilterList` component is a multiselection control with the ability to filter options. It is a stateful component, with an `items` props for specifying the set of options and a `onSelectionChange` prop to be notified of changes. 

The `FilterList` component is hosted in a `FilterListDemo` component that holds the application state and allows mutation via a reducer.
